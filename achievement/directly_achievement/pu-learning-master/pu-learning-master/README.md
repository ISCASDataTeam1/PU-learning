Positive and Unlabled Learning (pu-learning)
===========

A set of machine learning tools and algorithms for learning from positive and unlabled datasets.

Tools
-------

PUAdapter: A tool that adapts any estimator that can output a probability to positive-unlabled learning.
           It is based on: Elkan, Charles, and Keith Noto. "Learning classifiers from only positive and unlabeled data."
